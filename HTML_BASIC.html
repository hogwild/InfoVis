        <h1> some basics of HTML</h1>
        <ol>
            <li> Elements are the basics of HTML. Different elements are represented by different tags. For example, "&ltp&gt &lt/p&gt" is the tag of element "paragaraph"; "&ltp&gt" is called opening tag and "&lt/p&gt" is called closing tag </li>
            <li> Every element has its own attributions which can be set in the opening tag.  For example, in &ltp lang="en-us"&gt, "lang" is the attribution of language. Please note, even the events that related to the element can also be set in this way. For example, in &lt button type="submit" id="btn_submit" onclick="btnAction()"&gt, onclick is one of the events belonging to button, it can be connectted to the js function bitAction() in the opening tag. However, you are not encouraged to connected js function in this way, because it makes the HTML and js code mixed together. A better solution is to do it in a js file only.</li>
